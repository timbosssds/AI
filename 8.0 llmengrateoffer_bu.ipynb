      "## Purpose  \n",
      "This policy provides rules and guidance to staff when a customer contacts the bank seeking a rate negotiation. Staff must assess the customer’s eligibility based on key criteria to ensure fair and responsible lending practices.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Eligibility Criteria  \n",
      "Rate negotiations must consider the following factors:\n",
      "\n",
      "### 1. Credit History  \n",
      "- **Defaults & Arrears**: Customers with recent defaults or arrears (past 12 months) may not be eligible for rate reductions.\n",
      "- **High-Risk Spending**: Frequent transactions at gambling institutions, payday lenders, or other high-risk entities may impact eligibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 2. Borrower Type  \n",
      "- **Age**: Customers nearing retirement (above 55) may require additional review based on future income stability.\n",
      "- **Location**: Customers in high-risk postcodes (e.g., areas with declining property values) may not qualify for lower rates.\n",
      "- **Occupation & Industry**: Customers employed in volatile industries (e.g., hospitality, retail, gig economy) may require additional assessment.\n",
      "\n",
      "### 3. Financial Position  \n",
      "- **Income Stability**: Customers with irregular income sources (e.g., casual employment, contract work) may require a higher risk assessment.\n",
      "- **Savings & Emergency Funds**: Customers with minimal savings or high discretionary spending may be considered higher risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Approval Process  \n",
      "1. **Customer Inquiry**: Staff collect relevant financial details and history.\n",
      "2. **Assessment**: Evaluate against the above criteria.\n",
      "3. **Escalation**: If the case is borderline, refer to a senior credit officer.\n",
      "4. **Decision & Communication**: Provide the customer with the outcome and rationale.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Exceptions  \n",
      "Exceptions may be made for long-standing customers, those experiencing temporary hardship, or high-value clients at the discretion of a senior credit officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Compliance  \n",
      "All decisions must align with responsible lending obligations and be recorded in internal systems for audit purposes.\n",
